when schedule?
linux: after syscall, interrupt, check current->need_sched

can syscall interrupted?
yes

can schedule interrupted?
no
linux: cli before schedule


problems:
1. sometime when schedule Page fault, because current is wrong, because process_t not 2*PAGE_SIZE aligned.
need a better phyical mem manager, because process_t need 2*PAGE_SIZE aligned
2. why get unknown syscall if I use a spinlock in kprintf?
3. page fault, when I make fork a function
4. when in syscall, if interrept come, how to do?
if in a fork syscall, then a clock interrept come, and need schedule, how to do?
5. now init.cc have no _start, it's binary file, so if I put a function before main, it will be _start...
need implement load elf instead binary file.
6. init now only load 512 byte, so check it less than 512

todo:
MM:
1.physical memory manager, buddy
2.vm, vm_area, page fault
3.mmap
4.brk
5.kmalloc, kfree
6.io buffer

interrupt, exception:
1. apic

process:
1.exit
2.sleep
3.fork: pgdir, vm
4.exec: vm, load elf

graphic:
1.console: scroll, read, lock and so on

fs:
1.super block
